# colinvandermeer.github.io

This is a small personal website to showcase a little bit about myself. It's written in raw HTML + CSS and compiled together using Eleventy and Vite.

`npm run dev` Launchs a dev server
`npm run build` Uses Vite to build the site (this is what will run on a server, so make sure to test it)
`npm run winbuild` If you're on a windows machine this will build it (there's some command incompatibilites with the original build script)
`npm run deploy` This will deploy the site to github pages
