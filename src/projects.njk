<p>This was a game I made as part of our school's food waste reduction campaign. The campaign was centered around a real pig named Bluebell who lived on one of our teacherâ€™s farm. People would donate their food waste from our cafeteria to be fed to Bluebell the pig instead of being thrown into the landfill.</p>

<p>The game was envisioned as a score attack game where you would compete with your friends on a school wide leaderboard. I worked as the head developer and project lead. We had a team of three developers five artists and one musician by the end of development.</p>
