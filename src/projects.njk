<p>This was a game I made as part of our school's food waste reduction campaign. The campagin was centered around a real pig named Bluebell who lived on one of our teacher’s farm. People would donate their food waste from our cafeteria to be fed to Bluebell the pig instead of being thrown into the landfill.</p>

<p>The game was invisioned as a score attack game where you would compete with your friends on a school wide leaderboard. I worked as the head devloper and project lead. We had a team of three developers five artists and one musician by the end of development.</p>
